		<Overview>The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo was about the adventures of
			Scooby Doo, Shaggy Rogers, Daphne Blake, and Scrappy-Doo chasing
			after more mysteries. Now they are joined by a magnificent warlock
			called Vincent Van Ghoul, who is a cartoon cariature of Vincent Price
			(who also provided the voice), and a mischievous boy named Flim-Flam.
			Together they have to catch 13 ghosts and put them in a magical
			"Chest of Demons" that Scooby and Shaggy were tricked into opening by
			two sneaky ghosts named Weerd and Bogel. This was the last cartoon
			series that the original Scooby-Doo gang (minus Fred and Velma)
			appeared in for nearly 20 years. In 1988, the entire gang returned to
			TV as children in A Pup Named Scooby Doo, but they wouldn't resurface
			again weekly in their adult form until 2002 in What's New
			Scooby-Doo?.</Overview>

		<Overview>The first incarnation of what has become a
			franchise-of-sorts, Scooby-Doo is a large, loveable but cowardly
			Great Dane who hangs around four California high school students
			(Fred, Velma, Daphne and Shaggy). The four teen-agers are in constant
			search of mysteries and adventures, driving around in a bright green
			van known as the Mystery Machine. Many of the group's adventures
			involve villians who take on supernatural disguises (ghosts and
			monsters); the villians' activities usually involve blackmail, theft,
			fraud and other forms of corruption.</Overview>
