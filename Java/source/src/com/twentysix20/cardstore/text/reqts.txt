 	- use DAO?
 - For each card, for each store, choose the cheapest cards possible across sets to meet the # needs
 	- What if, for multiple copies, two versions at one store are cheaper than a version at another store?
 	- What if one store has 3 copies for .10 and you need 5, so it goes to another store
